## Day 1 Solution Steps: A christmas crisis
1. Install browser extensions like ‘edit this cookie’ or any other cookie manager browser add
2. After login to the site - click on the add to view the cookie name (key) with just a one click - rather that going into the dev tools
3. Copy the auth cookie value and navigate to the cyberchef site https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ paste the same - a magic stick will appear click on it - it will show the encoded format and the decoded value below
4. The decoded value is in key:value pair in ‘JSON’ format
5. Replace your username in the decoded value with ‘santa’ value and encode the same with ‘Hex’
6. Copy paste the resulted value into your auth cookie and refresh the site - boom! You will logged in as santa user - activate all the button to get the flags 

## Day 2 Solution Steps: The elf strikes back.
1. At the end of you machine target IP add ‘/id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw’ it will look something like http://<IP>?id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw
2. Analysis response page script for the allowed extensions (.jpeg, .png) - the answer is ‘images’
3. Do dirsearch for the target machine with the default scripts or analysis the upload file POST request directory - the answer is ‘/uploads’
4. Upload the php reverse shell - get the php file from https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php copy paste the code, edit the IP and port with your machine IP and your wish port and rename the extension as .jpeg.png and upload the same
5. Netcat with the flag ‘-nvlp’ on the same port 
6. Access the file in http://<IP>/uploads/<file>.php you will get the reverse shell, cat the flag file in /var/www/flag.txt to get the same   

## Day 3 Solution Steps: The Christmas chaos.
1. Load the target site IP into your browser
2. Configure the browser proxy with burp as instructed in the room 
3. Give some test credentials in the login page and capture the request in burp 
4. Sent the request to intruder by pressing ‘Ctrl+i’ then do the necessary steps to brute force the username and password as instructed in the room description 
5. Start the attack, after the attack completes analys the length of the response - one response will have a lesser response length
